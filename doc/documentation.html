<h1>luisavm 0.1 documentation</h1>
<hr>

<p>This is the documentation for the <b>luisavm</b> project.<p>

<p><b>luisavm</b> is an emulator for a fictional computer. This computer is in
the same style as a 80s computer (like Commodore 64 or MSX) but with modern
computer amenities, such as a much faster microprocessor and almost "infinite"
RAM and video memory.</p>

<p>This emulator has several uses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since it is a very simple architecture, it can be used for learning 
        about computer architecture and low level software;
    <li>It can be used for writing operating systems and, since the architecture 
        is simple, testing new ideas on operating system development;
    <li>It can be embedded in application as a DLL, running multiple VMs at the same
        time;
    <li>It can be used for writing games and other types of software.
</ul>
